Note that for the above performance the input vector must exclude the aaxyz part, which requires a modification to
hypertree_train.py semantic_translation_regression data features.

They should be set as follows:
        # data_features = ['image/preprocessed', 'current_xyz_3']
        1cm random translation was also added to the input vector.

We are currently trying out:
        data_features = ['image/preprocessed', 'current_xyz_aaxyz_nsc_8']

to see if translation and orientation information provides any advantage.
